      <p>Hello, and welcome to my page! My name is Andrew Dalton and this page is intended to give anyone reading it an idea of who I am and some of the coding projects I have been working on.</p>

      <h2><strong>Here's a little bit <em>about me</em> in more or less chronological order</strong></h2>
        <ol>
          <li>I was born in<span class="place">Jacksonville, Florida</span> on May 6th, 1990, but my family moved away when I was still very young and I've never been back since.</li>
          <li>I am the eighth sibling in a family of ten children!</li>
          <li>I grew up in <span class="place">Salt Lake City, Utah.</span></li>
          <li>I have lived in <span class="place">Portland, Oregon</span> for a total of four and a half years.</li>
          <li>I graduated from East Hollywood High School in <span class="place">West Valley, Utah</span> in 2008. I've done a tiny bit of college since then, but Epicodus is my first foray back into secondary education in a few years.</li>
          <li>I have spent most of my adult life working in the Food Service Industry, primarily with the company Whole Foods Market.</li>
          <li>I decided to get involved with Epicodus in order to help myself pursue a career in Video Game Design. It will be a few years before I'm there, but Epicodus seemed to me like a great place to start.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Before joining Epicodus, I had only a small amoung of experience with secondary education, as well as minimal experience with coding, and though it is proving very challenging, I am very much liking it and the effect it is having on my life and my way of thinking.</p>
