      <p>Hello, and welcome to my page! My name is Andrew Dalton and this page is intended to give anyone reading it an idea of who I am and some of the coding projects I have worked on and been working on.</p>

      <h2><strong>Here's a little bit <em>about me</em> in more or less chronological order</strong></h2>
        <ol>
          <li>I was born in Jacksonville, Florida on May 6th, 1990, but my family moved away when I was still very young and I've never been back since.</li>
          <li>I am the eighth sibling in a family of ten children.</li>
          <li>I grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah.</li>
          <li>I have lived in Portland, Oregon for a total of four and a half years.</li>
          <li>I graduated from East Hollywood High School in West Valley, Utah in 2008. I've done a tiny bit of college since then, but Epicodus is my first foray back into secondary education in a few years.</li>
          <li>I have spent most of my adult life working in the Food Service Industry, primarily with the company Whole Foods Market.</li>
          <li>I decided to get involved with Epicodus in order to help myself pursue a career in Video Game Design. It will be a few years before I'm there, but Epicodus seemed to me like a great place to start.</li>
        </ol>
